## 🎓 Tips & Tricks

✅ **DO:**
- Save frequently while coding
- Use descriptive names: "BFS - Graph" not "code1"
- Download and backup important solutions
- Version your iterations: "v1", "v2", "v3"
- Review previous solutions to spot patterns

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rely only on browser storage (no cloud backup yet)
- Use vague names like "test" or "final"
- Save every single keystroke (save when complete)
- Keep too many old versions (clean up)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find Save button | Make sure you're in Code Practice or Problem Editor |
| Files (0) shows, but thought I saved | Browser cache was cleared - files were lost |
| Downloaded file is empty | Refresh page and try again |
| Hitting file limit (50 files) | Delete some old files first |
| Files disappeared | Browser history/cache was cleared - always download backups! |
